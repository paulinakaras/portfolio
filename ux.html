                    <h1>Design Ways  - client of the project</h1>
                    <p>In March 2019, I started my postgraduate studies at the European University in Cracow, where I began my first project which dealt with the organizational issues that had to be solved at the Design Ways conference in Cracow. This event is held by people from a diverse range of creative industries, and had already taken place the year before. During the first event, organizers faced a number of problems that needed to be addressed in order to improve the experience of the participants.
                    Our aim was to design an application which facilitated the organization of the event, thereby allowing people to share tasks and communicate effectively
                    Out of our four team members, I was responsible for communicating between users and our client while finding people willing to be interviewed during the preparatory phase. I was involved throughout the product development process, from beginning to end.</p>
                    <h1>Design challenge</h1>
                    <p>The design challenge was to create a product for a small number of people working at the conference:
                    3 organizers and 10 volunteers. Many of the young people who attended the event were often temporarily unavailable due to breaks and study sessions between semesters. Therefore, we were not able to collect a lot of data and statistics for our client and the files were often truncated. Due to this we had to be especially thorough during the research phase. Above are the individual screens of the dashboard. For more information click <a class="red" href="https://uxfol.io/paulina.karas" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
